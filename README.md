Hello. I'm Harini Solaidurairaj. 

I am a Computer Science Student at University of Illinois at Chicago, expected to graduate in Spring 2027. I am currently working as a Mathematical Foundations of Computing Teaching Assistant, and as a Student Mentor with UIC Girls Who Code. I'm currently looking for Software Development opportunities for Summer 2025.

I am passionate about computer science, learning and teaching! I first took a CS class when I was a freshman in high school. I never had an initial or immediate love for programming, I actually thought it was quite tedious and annoying. Now it's what I study full time. While I still think it's tedious, time-consuming and slightly annoying, I love using it to create programs and test limits on what tech can be as well as what I can create using it. Computer science comes with an endless string of new ideas to learn, and I strive to keep learning more and more about programming, continuing to be amazed at what I can do with it. 

This passion for the cycle of learning and teaching is what compels me to be a Teaching Assistant and Student Mentor. I hope to share my love for computer science, by learning with and guiding others in these positions. 

Programming Languages: Python(proficient), C++(Proficient), C(Proficient) JavaScript/HTML/CSS(Intermediate), and Java(Intermediate)
Tech Skills: IntelliJ, VSCode, Git, CLion, and PYCharm
